## Installation

To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow (if using neural networks)

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction.git
cd stock-price-prediction
```

2. **Prepare the data**:
   - Download historical stock price data (e.g., from Yahoo Finance) and save it as a CSV file in the `data` directory.
   - Update the data loading script to point to your data file.

3. **Run the training script**:

```bash
python train.py
```

4. **Make predictions**:

```bash
python predict.py
```

## Data

The data used for this project should be historical stock prices with columns typically including:

- Date
- Open
- High
- Low
- Close
- Volume

The data should be saved as a CSV file in the `data` directory.

## Models

This project supports multiple machine learning models, including:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks (using TensorFlow/Keras)

Model training scripts are located in the `src/model_training.py` file.

## Evaluation

Model evaluation is performed using standard metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Evaluation scripts are located in the `src/model_evaluation.py` file.
